Redux best practices
==============

[*Version fran√ßaise ici*](/fr/redux)

At [Mapado](https://www.mapado.com), we are using more and more React and Redux. As they are very permissive librairies, each developer has its own way of coding with them.

We needed to standardize how we do it. It's now done!

This document is still "in progress", we are not necessarily sure of some of our choices, but they seem to be the best for us right now.

Moreover, we would welcome your comments if you have different use cases, either by opening [an issue](https://github.com/mapado/best-practices/issues), or by mentioning [@Mapado_com](https://www.twitter.com/Mapado_com) on Twitter.

### Libraries we use with Redux
  * Selectors: [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect)
  * Data structure: [immutable-js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
  * Middleware for async actions: [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)

### State immutability

States **MUST** be an immutable-js `Map` or `Record`.


### State initialization

The "state" **SHOULD** be initialized by default with every key it can use.

> It allows components props to be set every time, without having to test `if null` cases.
>
> It frees the "containers" to avoid code like this: `state.foo.get('bar') || false`.

We **CAN** use an immutable `Record` to forbid any new key in the state, and to give us some syntaxic sugar (`state.foo.bar` instead of `state.foo.get('bar')`).

#### Removing keys
We **MUST NOT** delete key from state.

> If we delete a key, we will be in the same case as mentioned before.

Prefer `state.set('foo', false)`, or `state.set('foo', null)` instead of `state.remove('foo')`.

### Dispatch in actions

We **SHOULD NOT** send too many `dispatch` in actions.

We **SHOULD NOT** send two successive `dispatch` if there is no need to refresh the view.

> Calling `dispatch` will refresh React components.

This job is more suited for the reducer:

üëé
```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'FOO':
      return foo(state, action.foo);
    case 'BAR':
      return bar(state, action.bar);
  }
}

function simpleAction() {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({
      type: 'FOO',
      foo: 'foo',
    });
  };
}

function complexAction() {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({
      type: 'FOO',
      foo: 'foo',
    });
    dispatch({
      type: 'BAR',
      bar: 'bar',
    });
  };
}
```

üëç
```js
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'FOO':
      return foo(state, action.foo);
    case 'FOO and BAR':
      return fooAndBar(state, action.foo, action.bar);
  }
}

function simpleAction() {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({
      type: 'FOO',
      foo: 'foo',
    });
  }
}

function complexAction() {
  return (dispatch) => {
    dispatch({
      type: 'FOO and BAR',
      foo: 'foo',
      bar: 'bar',
    });
  }
}
```

### Data action status
When we make an async call, we often need to know the state of this call (to display a loader or an error message, for example).

Let's call "data key" the key in which the data will be stored in our redux state once fetched.

We **COULD** store the *status* of its data in another redux state key.

The data key concerning the status **MUST** have the following form: `<data key>-<action>-<status>`.

> The `-` separator here does the same job as they do in BEM.
>
> As our states are immutable-js objects, using `-` here is not really inconvenient.

`<action>` is the name of the action performed on the data, for example "articleList-fetch-status".


The value **MUST** be a `Map` containing a `status` key and an `error` key.

#### Value of the `status` key

The `status` key value **SHOULD** take one of the following value:
  * null
  * IN_PROGRESS
  * SUCCEEDED
  * FAILED

It **CAN** also take a custom value, for example:
  * IN_PROGRESS_BOTTOM
  * IN_PROGRESS_TOP

#### Value of the `error` key
The error **MUST** be in the status object and its key must be `error`.

Its default value **MUST** be `null`.

Its value **SHOULD** be a string or an object.

The error logic is managed in the component.


#### Special case : performing operations on a list item
Operations on a list item **MUST** follow the same logic, but **CAN** be stored in a `Map`.

The keys of these `Map` **SHOULD** be the concerned item id.

Example:
```js
const state = {
  ticketList: [],

  'ticketList-fetch-status': {
    status: 'SUCCEEDED',
    error: null,
  },

  'ticketList-processingPrinting-status': {
    8: {
      status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
      error: null,
    },
    9: {
      status: 'ERROR',
      error: 'No more paper',
    },
  },
}
```


### Selector vs complex state
The state **SHOULD** be used to store "raw" datas.

A selector **SHOULD** be used to "group" / "filter" / "sort" in other words, "work" on raw datas to send them to the component.

You can check out the [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) documentation to find out about selectors.

### List vs Map vs Collection
We **SHOULD** suffix the key name by the type of data:

  * If it's an article `List`, the key should be named `articleList`.
  * If it's an article `Map`, the key should be named `articleMap`.
  * If it's a custom `FooBarCollection` object containing articles, the key should be named `articleFooBarCollection`.

We need to keep the naming of the "status" key like previously.

In our example, the status key will be named `articleFooBarCollection-fetch-status`.


### Nesting state
The state **SHOULD NOT** have more than one nesting level.

üëé

```js
  article: {
    items: [ /* some articles */ ],
    'fetch-status': {
      status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
      error: null,
    }
  },
  tag: {
    items: [ /* some tags */ ],
    'fetch-status': {
      status: 'SUCCEEDED',
      error: null,
    }
  },
```

üëç

```js
  articleList: [ /* some articles */ ],
  'articleList-fetch-status': {
    status: 'IN_PROGRESS',
    error: null,
  },
  tagList: [ /* some tags */ ],
  'tagList-fetch-status': {
    status: 'SUCCEEDED',
    error: null,
  },
```

### Mono-state vs multi-state

We **SHOULD** have only one "state" in a simple application.

We **CAN** split **functionally** the states in a complex application.

## Work in progress
### [Redux-thunk] getState in actions

`getState()` **SHOULD NOT** be used in actions.

We need to test this in very specific cases.

Maybe having more "containers" for component nesting.
